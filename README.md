# New personal website

Wanting to do a complete update on my personal site at [simonbeirouti.com](https://simonbeirouti.com) and I wanted to integrate login access to continue learning the flow of full-stack apps. I have approached it this way so that those that land on the site, will be prompted to create an account.

I have used the following tools:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwind.css)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- [LandingFolio](https://landingfolio.com)

## Current

When the visitor hits the website they will be prompted by a nice message and a sign-in/sign-up form. Once they accept the email request and click on the link, they will return to the website and be able to check the content.
